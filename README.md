## Project Proposal
We are proposing a database that supports a designer baby store. This database would provide support for ‘baby parts’ allowing clients (or parents) to customize the traits of their baby - for a cost! Parents genetics would provide information for the default state of the child. Not only this, there will also be a pool of donors that can supply a diverse selection of features that a single-parent can choose from.

It would also support business-like functions such as invoices and profits. In particular, calculations can add different traits and its prices to sum into a billing total. The significance is to potentially provide wider access to genetic manipulations that may be used to eradicate genetic dysfunctions or make prettier babies. 

### Software Stack

The database was designed and built with MySql. 
The supporting web application was made with React and Redux. The website is able to query the database with Node.js.
